title: Time to jekyll the shit out of this thing.
---

So let's go again and start doing this crap just with VSCode and git.
Still a lot to go through the_config.yml and learn it's structure. Using Jekyll-now ofc just cause cba to bother to install ruby everwhere.

Well given that it is x-mas eve and I'm sitting here all dressed up in a suit and that I'm going to church for the first time in quite some time. Or atleast the first time in during x-mas. Gotta learn more MarkDown yeah. Otherwise these posts are going to look and feel terrible.
